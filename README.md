Hi, I'm Sritha and I'm a software developer & tester with over 3 years of experience in all aspects of the software development lifecycle. 

I have been interested in programming since I was a child. What I enjoy the most about programming is the infinite possibilities which are only limited by a programmer's expertise and creativity.

I am always eager to learn new technologies to constantly improve my skillset. I work on personal programming projects so that I can apply the skills that I have learnt.

When I am not working, I enjoy reading and writing.
